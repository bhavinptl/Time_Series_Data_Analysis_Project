# Time_Series_Data_Analysis_Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of time series data related to air passenger numbers. The primary goal is to gain insights into passenger trends, patterns, and make forecasts using various time series analysis techniques.

Dataset

Dataset Name: AirPassengers.csv

Source: Kaggle

Description: The dataset contains monthly data on the number of air passengers, with a timestamp for each observation.

Analysis Steps
Data Exploration: Initial exploration of the dataset, including data type conversion and visualization.

Data Preprocessing: Data transformation and stationarity checks.

Time Series Decomposition: Decomposing the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.

Autocorrelation Analysis: Analyzing autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation to determine model parameters.

Model Building:

AR (AutoRegressive) Model

MA (Moving Average) Model

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) Model

Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance and selecting the best-fitting model.

Forecasting: Generating forecasts for future time periods.
